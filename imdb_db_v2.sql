During the war, Jyn and her parents were captured by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, however they were rescued by Orson Krennic, an old friend of her father&#39;s and a member of Republic Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine&#39;s top secret Death Star project. Jyn was separated from her parents at the age of fifteen years old, developing a reckless and rebellious streak. She had a number of incidents on her record, including the forgery of Imperial documents, possession of stolen property, aggravated assault, and resisting arrest.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" />\r\n	<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" />\r\n	<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Almost two decades into the Empire&#39;s reign, Erso was detained by the Rebel Alliance. However, with the Alliance having intercepted a transmission from her father, indicating that a major weapons test was about to occur, Erso was given another chance and was recruited by a leader of the Alliance, Mon Mothma, to learn more about the weapon test. As a result, Erso became a sergeant of the Alliance and involved in the theft of what the Rebels would discover to be the plans to the Death Star, an armored battle station capable of destroying entire planets, which would ultimately lead to the destruction of the station during the Battle of Yavin.</span></p>\r\n'),

After the Galactic Empire was formed, Krennic was promoted to commander and later the fleet equivalence of admiral. He also served as Director of the Advanced Weapons Research division of the Imperial Military during the Galactic Civil War. He was responsible for the security of the Death Star project, and commanded a squad of death troopers, wielded as his personal weapon against the Rebel Alliance.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" />\r\n	<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" />\r\n	<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">During a battle between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance, Krennic met his end on the planet Scarif, where Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin deployed the Death Star to eliminate the Empire&#39;s military base in an attempt to prevent the Death Star plans from being extracted.</span></p>\r\n'),
(10, 'Grand Moff Tarkin', '<p>\r\n	<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Grand Moff Tarkin was the Governor of the Imperial Outland Regions. He was appointed Grand Moff - the only Imperial officer to hold such a title - by Emperor Palpatine. He was so close to the Emperor that he was given some authority over even Darth Vader (as evidenced in a meeting of Imperial General Staff when he orders Vader to stop &#39;the grip&#39; on General Motti). Tarkin&#39;s ambition to succeed Palpatine as emperor had led him to use extreme methods to quell the rapidly growing Rebel Alliance. His major project was to undertake the construction of the Death Star battle station (he is seen briefly in &#39;Revenge of the Sith&#39; next to the Emperor &amp; Vader, watching the construction of the big, steely orb that will become the Death Star). When the Death Star was completed, it was to be used as a base to rule the entire galaxy. With a superlaser capable of destroying an entire planet, it was considered by Tarkin &amp; other Imperial General Staff to be invincible.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" />\r\n	<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" />\r\n	<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">When the Death Star&#39;s plans are stolen, the Emperor assigns Darth Vader to recover them - and the recovery attempt results in the capture of Princess Leia but fails to recover the plans. Tarkin is obsessed with finding the Rebels&#39; main base, and he has Vader resort to extreme measures - such as torture - to find out that location. Even though Vader has her tortured, she tells him nothing, and Tarkin suggests that threatening the Princess&#39; home world - Alderaan - with the Death Star&#39;s destructive power. Tarkin&#39;s bluff works - to a point, as Princess Leia gives him the name of Dantooine. But the fiendish Tarkin orders Alderaan&#39;s destruction all the same, and then finds out that Dantooine was NOT the Rebels&#39; main base. Tarkin gives the order to terminate her, but she is rescued by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo &amp; Chewbacca before it can be carried out. When he finds out the Princess has escaped, Tarkin comes up with a plan; he will have a homing beacon placed on Han Solo&#39;s &#39;Millenium Falcon&#39; in the hope that if the ship escapes, it will lead them to the secret Rebel base. With the tractor beam put out of action by Ben Kenobi, Tarkin&#39;s plan works, and the Death Star is led to the fourth moon of Yavin. However, the Rebels launch an offensive attack against the Death Star, consisting of dozens of X- and Y-Wing fighters. They are too fast for the Death Star&#39;s slow-moving turbolasers, designed for use against capital ships. Tarkin, however, believes his battle station is invincible, even when told by one of his officers that the attacking Rebels do present a danger. The Grand Moff stubbornly refuses to leave his post in the Death Star&#39;s main command center, and watches as the fourth moon comes up on the Death Star&#39;s targeting screen. Seconds after giving the order, &#39;You may fire when ready&#39;, Tarkin is dead - the Death Star is blown apart when Luke Skywalker&#39;s torpedoes find their mark and strike the reactor.</span></p>\r\n'),
(11, 'Saw Gerrera', '<p>\r\n	<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Saw Gerrera was a human male resistance fighter who, as a leading member of the Onderon rebels, fought against the Confederacy of Independent Systems on Onderon during the Clone Wars. He and his sister, Steela Gerrera, were instrumental in the rebel liberation of their homeworld during the Battle of Onderon. He later became a key member in the fight against the Galactic Empire and the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. His tactics against the Empire led him to be seen as an extremist, one whose notoriety was recognized by the Empire and, many years later, the New Republic.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" />\r\n	<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" />\r\n	<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">In the early resistance against the Separatist Alliance on Onderon, Gerrera and his fellow soldiers were outnumbered and out-fought by the Separatist Droid Army. They requested help from the Jedi High Council, which led the Grand Army of the Republic in its fight against the Separatists, but the Jedi Order chose not to become actively involved in the fighting on Onderon. Instead, they sent a team of advisorsGenerals Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Commander Ahsoka Tano, and Clone Captain CT-7567 (&quot;Rex&quot;)to train the Onderonian fighters. The Jedi and Captain Rex taught them proper techniques and strategies for taking on the battle droid army, and, through their efforts, the rebels began to turn the tide. Gerrera came to resent that the rebels chose Steela as their leader, and he was soon captured in an ill-concocted solo effort to rescue the deposed king Ramsis Dendup from the Separatists. They were both rescued by the rebels, who eventually mounted a final battle against the Separatists. Through their efforts, the rebels liberated their world and returned Dendup to the throne. The fight, however, came at a personal cost; Steela was killed during the final battle, and Gerrera was left to mourn his sister. At the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire. Gerrera fought against the Imperial Military and led a resistance group known as the Partisans from the desert moon Jedha. His resistance cell, a continuation of the fighters from the Clone Wars, was one of the first in the group of cells that formed the Rebel Alliance. He was later involved in the Rebel mission to steal the plans to the Imperial superweapon known as the Death Star, by which time his more-extreme tactics had come to stand in stark contrast with those of Alliance leaders Bail Organa and Mon Mothma. During the time of the New Republic, Senator Ransolm Casterfo suggested that Gerrera and his Partisans, though part of the Rebel Alliance, engaged in terrorist tactics.</span></p>\r\n'),

She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado, and has English, as well as smaller amounts of Danish, Swiss-German, and Norwegian, ancestry.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder&#39;s Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as &quot;Brigadoon&quot; and &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theater work.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157503?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Mu&eacute;rete, bonita</a>&nbsp;(1999), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000263?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Kirstie Alley</a>&nbsp;encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139134?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Cruel Intentions</a>&nbsp;(1999), in the part played in the film by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001264?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>, &quot;Kathryn Merteuil&quot;. Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196267?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Cruel Intentions 2</a>&nbsp;(2000). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Catch Me If You Can</a>&nbsp;(2002), playing opposite&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410978?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Dr. Vegas</a>&nbsp;(2004).<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Her role in the low-budget independent film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418773?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Junebug</a>&nbsp;(2005) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards.

Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Adams next appeared in the major production,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472062?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Charlie Wilson&#39;s War</a>&nbsp;(2007), and went on to act in the independent film,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862846?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Sunshine Cleaning</a>&nbsp;(2008), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.

After a tumultuous yet happy childhood with his four younger siblings, Renner graduated from Beyer High School and attended Modesto Junior College. He explored several areas of study, including computer science, criminology, and psychology, before the theater department, with its freedom of emotional expression, drew him in.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	However, Renner recognized the potential in acting as much through the local police academy as through drama classes. During his second year at Modesto Junior College, Renner role-played a domestic disturbance perpetrator as part of a police-training exercise for an easy $50. Deciding to shift his focus away from schoolwork, Renner left college and moved to San Francisco to study at the American Conservatory Theater. From there he moved to Hawaii and, in 1993, to Los Angeles.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In Los Angeles, Renner devoted himself to theater, most notably starring in and co-directing the critically acclaimed &quot;Search and Destroy.&quot; He pursued other projects during this time as well, landing his first film role in 1995&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113936?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Desmadre sobre ruedas</a>&nbsp;(1995). After several commercials and supporting roles in television movies and series, Renner captured the attention of critics with his gripping, complex portrayal of the infamous serial killer in the 2002 film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285728?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Dahmer</a>&nbsp;(2002). Renner&#39;s performance, which earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination, is especially remarkable for painting a humane and sympathetic, yet deeply disturbing, portrait of the title character.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In 2003, Renner took a break from small indie films to work on his first commercially successful movie,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257076?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">S.W.A.T.</a>&nbsp;(2003), with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0268199?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Colin Farrell</a>.

Renner&#39;s performance as a single-minded bomb specialist scored him an Academy Award nomination for best actor. He also earned best actor nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards, the Screen Actors Guild, and the BAFTA Awards, as well as wins in this category from several film critics groups.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In 2009, Renner starred in the short-lived TV series,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1240976?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">The Unusuals</a>&nbsp;(2009), and in 2010 he played the chilling but loyal criminal Jem in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Ben Affleck</a>&nbsp;bank-heist thriller&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840361?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">The Town</a>&nbsp;(2010).

His visceral depiction of these individuals captivates audiences and empowers him to steal scenes in many of his films, even when playing a minor role. Renner gravitates toward flawed, complicated, three-dimensional characters that allow him to explore new territory within himself.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In addition to his work as an actor, Renner continues to cultivate his lifelong love of music. A singer, songwriter, and musician, he performed with the band Sons of Ben early in his career. Scenes in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383478?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Love Comes to the Executioner</a>&nbsp;(2006),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395972?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">North Country</a>&nbsp;(2005), and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443680?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a>&nbsp;(2007) briefly showcase Renner&#39;s singing talents.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Despite traveling the world for film roles and, recently, as a United Nations Goodwill Peace Ambassador to raise awareness for mine-clearing efforts in Afghanistan, Renner remains close to his roots. In 2010, Modesto Junior College presented him the Distinguished Alumnus award in recognition of his body of work as an actor. He also headlined at a benefit for Modesto&#39;s Gallo Center for the Arts in the fall of 2010.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Renner maintains a sense of humility and gratitude, even in the wake of his recent successes and recognition. He keeps himself grounded by renovating and restoring old and rundown iconic Hollywood homes, an enterprise he began back in his early days in Los Angeles. He values loyalty and a sense of both age and history, and enjoys the opportunity to help conserve these qualities in a town that favors the young and the new.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px 0.75em; line-height: 18.2px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">\r\n	<em>- IMDb Mini Biography By:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/name?bio_author=jamseattle31&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha" name="ba" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">jamseattle31</a></em></p>\r\n'),

He won an Academy Award for his performance as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in the 2006 film The Last King of Scotland, and has also won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA. He is the fourth African-American male to win an Academy Award for Best Actor, following in the footsteps of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001627?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Sidney Poitier</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000243?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Denzel Washington</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004937?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jamie Foxx</a>.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Whitaker was born on July 15, 1961 in Longview, Texas, to Laura Francis (Smith), a special education teacher, and Forest Steven Whitaker, an insurance salesman. His family moved to South Central Los Angeles in 1965. The athletically-inclined Whitaker initially found his way into college via a football scholarship. Later, however, he transferred to USC where he set his concentration on music and earned two more scholarships training as an operatic tenor. This, in turn, led to another scholarship at Berkeley with a renewed focus on acting and the performing stage.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Whitaker made his film debut at the age of 21 in the raucous comedy&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083929?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</a>&nbsp;(1982) wherein he played, quite naturally, a footballer. He went on to play another sports-oriented student, a wrestler, in his second film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090270?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Vision Quest</a>&nbsp;(1985). He gained experience on TV as well with featured spots on such varied shows as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077003?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Diff&#39;rent Strokes</a>&nbsp;(1978) and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083395?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Cagney &amp; Lacey</a>&nbsp;(1981), not to mention the TV-movie Civil War epic&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088583?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">North and South</a>&nbsp;(1985) and its sequel. The movie that truly put him on the map was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090863?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">The Color of Money</a>&nbsp;(1986). His one big scene as a naive-looking pool player who out-hustles&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000056?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Paul Newman</a>&#39;s Fast Eddie Felson was pure electricity. This led to more visible roles in the &quot;A&quot; class films&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091763?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Platoon</a>&nbsp;(1986),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094025?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Stakeout</a>&nbsp;(1987), and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093105?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Good Morning, Vietnam</a>&nbsp;(1987), which culminated in his breakout lead portrayal of the tortured jazz icon &#39;Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker&#39; in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Clint Eastwood</a>&#39;s passion project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094747?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Bird</a>&nbsp;(1988), for which Whitaker won the Cannes Film Festival award for &quot;best actor&quot; and a Golden Globe nomination. Whitaker continued to work with a number of well-known directors throughout the 1990s.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	While his &quot;gentle giant&quot; characters typically display innocence, indecision, and timidity along with a strong underlying humanity, he has certainly not shied away from the edgier, darker corners of life as his occasional hitmen and other menacing streetwise types can attest. Although in only the first section of the film, he was memorable as the IRA-captured British soldier whose bizarre relationship with a mysterious femme fatale serves as the catalyst for the critically-lauded drama&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104036?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">The Crying Game</a>&nbsp;(1992). Always a willing participant to push the envelope, he&#39;s gone on to enhance a number of lesser films. Among those was his plastic surgeon in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097626?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Johnny Handsome</a>&nbsp;(1989), gay clothing designer in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000265?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Robert Altman</a>&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110907?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Ready to Wear</a>&nbsp;(1994), alien hunter in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114508?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Species</a>&nbsp;(1995), absentee father confronted by his estranged son in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114478?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Smoke</a>&nbsp;(1995), and Mafia hitman who models himself after the samurai warrior in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165798?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Ghost Dog, el camino del samur&aacute;i</a>&nbsp;(1999), among many others.

On the TV front, he was the consulting producer and host of a revamped&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0785245?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Rod Serling</a>&#39;s cult series classic&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318252?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Los l&iacute;mites de la realidad</a>&nbsp;(2002), which lasted a disappointing one season.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In the early 1990s, Whitaker widened his horizons to include producing/directing and has since gained respect behind the camera as well. He started things off co-producing the violent gangster film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102749?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">A Rage in Harlem</a>&nbsp;(1991), in which he co-starred with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002138?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Gregory Hines</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002101?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Robin Givens</a>, and then made his successful directorial debut with the soulful&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114885?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Waiting to Exhale</a>&nbsp;(1995), showcasing a legion of distaff black stars.

He also helmed the fluffy romantic comedy&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361620?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">First Daughter</a>&nbsp;(2004) with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005017?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Katie Holmes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Michael Keaton</a>. Whitaker also served as an executive producer on First Daughter. He had previously executive produced several made-for-television movies, most notably the 2002 Emmy-award winning Door to Door, starring&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000513?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">William H.

Getting his start in television, including The Henderson Kids and the long running soap opera Neighbours, Mendelsohn broke out with his performance as an ill-fated juvenile delinquent in the acclaimed coming of age film The Year My Voice Broke. Mendelsohn won the best supporting actor award from the Australian Film Institute, his first of eight nominations.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Mendelsohn went onto to become one of the most popular teen/young adult stars in Australia cinema, often rivaling other emerging talents of his generation, including Russell Crowe, Noah Taylor, and Guy Pearce, leading the Australian tabloid to nickname them &quot;the Mouse Pack&quot; in reference to the Rat Pack in America and Brit Pack in the UK, emerging at the same time. Among his peers, Mendelsohn seemed to corner the market on troubled, angry young men, thanks to his roles in Idiot Box, Metal Skin, and Nirvana Street Murder. But Mendelsohn also proved he was capable of being a romantic lead, starring in the comedies The Big Steal, Cosi, Spotswood, and Amy.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In the 1990s, Mendelsohn appeared in just one &quot;Hollywood&quot; film, the action film Vertical Limit, as one of two daredevil climbers on a rescue mission, often providing the film&#39;s comic relief. The film failed to find an audience and Mendelsohn returned to Australia, where he primarily worked in theater and television, despite earning best actor nominations from the Australian Film Institute and Australian Film Critics Circle for the drama Mullet, as a prodigal son returning to his small town. He also took steps to work in more international films such as The New World, Knowing and Australia. Mendelsohn has acknowledged that there was a period of almost two years that he had so little work, he considered leaving the acting profession entirely.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In 2009, Mendelsohn experienced a bit of a comeback with the role in the independent Australian films Beautiful Kate, as troubled man forced to return reunite with his dying father and come to terms with the death of his twin sister, with whom he had a complicated relationship. He was nominated for Australian Film Institute and Australian Film Critics Circle Best Actor in 2009. A year later, he appeared as Pope in Animal Kingdom, the most terrifying and violent member of a crime family. In 2010, he won Best Actor from the Australian Film Institute, Independent Film Award, and Australian Film Critics Circle.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Since 2010, Mendelsohn has become a major player in Hollywood as a character actor in both blockbuster films (The Dark Knight Rises) and critically acclaimed films such as Killing Them Softly and Place Beyond the Pines. In 2013 he appeared in the UK Starred Up, which earned him a Best Supporting Actor Award from the British Independent Film Awards. In 2014, he will also star in Ryan Gosling&#39;s Lost River, Slow West, and Exodus: Gods and Kings, along with a leading role in an untitled drama/thriller for Netflix.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Mendelsohn lives in the US with his wife, writer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1788301?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Emma Forrest</a>, and their daughter.

At the age of four Yen started taking up martial arts from his mother, who taught him wushu and tai chi until the age of eleven when his family emigrated to Boston, MA. From there he continued mastering wushi and tai chi. But after developing a huge interest in martial arts he eventually began getting into various others martial art styles, such as taekwondo, kick-boxing, boxing, karate etc. When Yen was sixteen his parents sent him to Beijing Wushu Academy so he could train Chinese martial arts under Master Wu Bin, well known as the coach of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001472?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jet Li</a>. He underwent intensive training for three years.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	After three years Yen was about to leave back to the US but made a side trip to Hong Kong. There he was accidentally introduced to famous Hong Kong action film-maker&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950759?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Woo-Ping Yuen</a>, who was responsible for bringing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jackie Chan</a>&nbsp;to super stardom and was looking for someone new to star in his films. Yen was offered a screen test - which he passed - and thereafter a 4-picture deal. Yen started out with stunt doubling duty on the magical martial arts film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084557?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">The Miracle Fighters</a>&nbsp;(1982). From there he starred in his first film,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088423?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Drunken Tai Chi</a>&nbsp;(1984) at the age of 19. He continued his early film career working independently with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950759?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Woo-Ping Yuen</a>&nbsp;and also applied for acting lessons as well as roles in TV series at TVB to gain more acting experience. He started getting a bit of attention in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, after he was offered a contract by D&amp;B Films Co&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0690934?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Dickson Poon</a>. Poon gave Yen major roles in the action films&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096236?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">La ira del tigre</a>&nbsp;(1988),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097539?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">El camino del drag&oacute;n</a>&nbsp;(1989) and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100967?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">El ojo del tigre</a>&nbsp;(1990), which became cult classics after their initial releases. These films eventually spread outside the Hong Kong film circuit and gave Yen a good reputation as a formidable onscreen action performer. But after a while, the company did not do well and in the end went bankrupt. This left Yen with no choice but to go back to TVB as well as venture into low-budget film-making making films, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102561?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Crystal Hunt</a>&nbsp;(1991) and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107405?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Revenge of the Cheetah</a>&nbsp;(1992).<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	But the misfortune didn&#39;t last long. Famous director&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007139?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Hark Tsui</a>&nbsp;had just made a successful attempt to revive the kung fu genre with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103285?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Once Upon a Time in China</a>&nbsp;(1991) which starred&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001472?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jet Li</a>. For the sequel&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105839?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">&Eacute;rase una vez en China II</a>&nbsp;(1992) Hark was looking for someone to play the new nemesis. Through Yen&#39;s early films and his rep as one of the most effective pound-for-pound on-screen fighters in Hong Kong, Hark became fascinated and decided to approach, discuss, and eventually cast him in the role of General Lan. The film became a turning point in Yen&#39;s career and his two fight scenes with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001472?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jet Li</a>&nbsp;revolutionized the standards of Hong Kong martial arts choreography at the time, and are still regarded as among the best fight scenes ever created in Hong Kong film history. Another acclaim by critics and movie goers was Yen&#39;s acting performance. It was so outstanding that he was nominated for &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; at the 1992 Hong Kong Film Awards.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	After the excellent showcase, Yen starred in other successful and classic films, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105859?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Dragon Inn</a>&nbsp;(1992) for director&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498064?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Raymond Lee</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108614?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Espada invencible</a>&nbsp;(1993) by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0538328?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Michael Mak</a>. But he still continued to work with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950759?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Woo-Ping Yuen</a>&nbsp;on films including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106376?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Heroes Among Heroes</a>&nbsp;(1993),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108148?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">El Mono de Hierro: Iron Monkey</a>&nbsp;(1993) and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111800?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Wing Chun</a>&nbsp;(1994). But after creative differences between them became apparent, both of them decided it was best to work on their own so they ended up going separate ways and haven&#39;t collaborated with each other ever since.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	During this period Yen got into TV and worked on a couple of series for ATV as actor and action director. The first was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256863?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">The Kung Fu Master</a>&nbsp;(1994) which depicted the life of martial arts legend Hung Hei-Kwan. The TV series was a big success and Yen continued the success by action directing and starring in the second successful series;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275352?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Fist of Fury</a>&nbsp;(1995). It retold the story of Chen Zhen, the character made famous by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000045?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Bruce Lee</a>&nbsp;in the original 1972 film classic with the same title. Aside the TV work, he was offered roles by prolific director/producer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0939147?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jing Wong</a>&nbsp;in films such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112909?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">The Saint of Gamblers</a>&nbsp;(1995) and got other offers which includes&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110418?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Circus Kids</a>&nbsp;(1994) where he co-starred with action star&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950707?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Biao Yuen</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113144?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Asian Cop: High Voltage</a>&nbsp;(1994) which was shot in the Philippines.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In 1996 - after fulfilling his contract deal with Wong Jing and returning deposit money to refuse making more films for him - Yen signed with the independent film company My Way Film Co. This became another turning point in his career in that he started learning directing and experimenting with film cameras. In 1997, he finally made his directorial debut with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172711?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Legend of the Wolf</a>&nbsp;(1997) and had created a different style of martial arts choreography. The film made a huge impact within fan communities around the world for its&#39; daring, braving, and fresh attempt of accomplishing something new for the then dying martial arts action genre in Hong Kong. There was and still is a mixture of people both admiring and looking down on this particular style. Yen continued to work as lead actor/director/action director on films such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162874?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Ballistic Kiss</a>&nbsp;(1998),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205395?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Shanghai Affairs</a>&nbsp;(1998). In 1999, he decided to try something different and ended up flying to Germany to work on the local TV film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223972?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Der Puma - K&auml;mpfer mit Herz: Puma, el coraz&oacute;n del guerrero</a>&nbsp;(1999) and its&#39; TV series counterpart.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In 2000, things took a turn for Yen once again when US-based film company Dimension Films called and offered him a major role in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144964?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Highlander: Endgame</a>&nbsp;(2000) as the immortal Jin Ke, making it his US debut. But sadly the film didn&#39;t perform well at the box-office and many fans consider it to be a part of its&#39; own franchise. Nevertheless, Yen&#39;s fan-base consider his action scenes to be highlights of the film; especially his duel with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001600?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Adrian Paul</a>. To Dimension Films&#39; credit though, offers followed shortly afterward. Yen was invited to work behind the camera on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310149?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">The Princess Blade</a>&nbsp;(2001) for Japanese director&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766263?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Shinsuke Sato</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187738?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Blade II</a>&nbsp;(2002) by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868219?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Guillermo del Toro</a>, the latter of which he also appeared in as the mute vampire Snowman.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In 2002 and 2003 respectively, Yen&#39;s career further progressed after he took on two memorable roles. Firstly, highly acclaimed Chinese director&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955443?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Yimou Zhang</a>&nbsp;offered Yen the part of assassin Sky in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299977?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Hero</a>&nbsp;(2002) starring&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001472?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jet Li</a>&nbsp;and resulted in one of the most anticipated Chinese films of 2002 which eventually became a mega hit around Asia. Secondly, director&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0229694?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">David Dobkin</a>&nbsp;casted him alongside&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jackie Chan</a>&nbsp;as the traitorous Wu Chow in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300471?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Shanghai Knights</a>&nbsp;(2003), the sequel to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184894?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Shanghai Noon</a>&nbsp;(2000). This film marked the first time Yen worked with Chan in his career. Both of these collaborations gave Yen more recognition in the US and in Hong Kong, which in turn gave him more opportunities as an actor and action director.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In the same year Yen decided to put hold of pursuing a career in Hollywood and flew back to Hong Kong to find quality work. Through his good friend and Hong Kong cinema expert&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004214?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Bey Logan</a>&nbsp;he signed up as action director for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351887?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Vampire Effect</a>&nbsp;(2003), produced by Emperor Multimedia Group Co. (EMG) and starring the pop stars&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1239735?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Gillian Chung</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1218953?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Charlene Choi</a>&nbsp;with in a cameo appearance by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jackie Chan</a>. The film earned him a nomination for &quot;Best Action Design&quot; at the 2003 Hong Kong Film Awards as well as the 2003 Golden Horse Awards, both of which he won prices for. He continued to work on few films after that, including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401439?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Black Rose Academy</a>&nbsp;(2004) as director and action director, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398373?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Blade of Kings</a>&nbsp;(2004) as actor where he once again worked with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000329?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Jackie Chan</a>&nbsp;on an anticipated fight scene which was satisfying enough for fans to see.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Later on in 2004 Yen&#39;s career took a totally different turn when&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007139?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Hark Tsui</a>&nbsp;offered him a leading role in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429078?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Siete espadas</a>&nbsp;(2005) which was an adaptation of a lengthy novel written by Liang Yu-Sheng about seven warriors and their mystical swords. Despite the disappointing box-office reception when it was released locally, the film was nonetheless a great showcase for Yen as an actor and action performer unlike anything he did previously in his career. Around the same time, Yen also teamed up with acclaimed Hong Kong director&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0948159?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Wilson Yip</a>&nbsp;and together they made the highly anticipated crime drama&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478024?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Duelo de dragones</a>&nbsp;(2005). The film was remarkable in that it successfully combined strong acting and unique storytelling/visuals with groundbreaking martial arts action. This concept went on to become favored by action film fans and Hong Kong Cinema fans in general after its&#39; release. Yen&#39;s way of shooting martial arts action - which was nothing like people had already seen - earned him a nomination and a price at the 2005 Hong Kong Film Awards for &quot;Best Action Design&quot;. The movie also led to a trend of similar Hong Kong action films where storytelling/visuals along with hard-hitting action scenes were to be highlighted as much as possible.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	After the success, Yen and Yip teamed up immediately for more projects which includes the comic book adaptation&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482930?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Dragon Tiger Gate</a>&nbsp;(2006) and the hard-hitting action drama&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0992911?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Flash Point</a>&nbsp;(2007), both of which were very successful at the box-office and within fan communities globally. These accomplishments made people regard Yen as the new pinnacle of Hong Kong martial arts/action films. Yen both earned the &quot;Best Action Design&quot; nomination at the 2006 Hong Kong Film Awards as well as the &quot;Best Action Direction&quot; nomination at 2006 Golden Bauhinia Awards for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482930?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Dragon Tiger Gate</a>&nbsp;(2006). He won a price for the latter while he was awarded for his action design on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0992911?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Flash Point</a>&nbsp;(2007) at both the 2007 Golden Bauhinia Awards and the 2007 Hong Kong Film Awards.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	From there on Yen continued to work as a lead actor and also developed an interest in improving his acting skills. He got a leading role in the battle epic&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186803?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">An Empress and the Warriors</a>&nbsp;(2008), directed by acclaimed Hong Kong action director&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155642?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Siu-Tung Ching</a>, which was a big success in Mainland China. He continued work starring in the supernatural romance film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1055300?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Painted Skin</a>&nbsp;(2008) by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0150906?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Gordon Chan</a>. Then he starred in the martial arts biopic&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220719?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Ip Man</a>&nbsp;(2008) helmed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0948159?ref_=nmbio_mbio" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">Wilson Yip</a>. This film was based on the life of one of Bruce Lee&#39;s wing chun teachers, Yip Man. The film became a sensational mega success all over Asia and people within the Hong Kong film industry started taking note after Wilson Yip&#39;s matured style of film-making, Sammo Hung&#39;s fresh martial arts choreography which many action film fans consider to be a redefinition of Hung&#39;s career as action director. But most impressive about the film for the audiences and critics was Yen&#39;s acting performance. During production, people had been very skeptical about Yen being the choice for the Yip Man role. But when the film was released, all pressure from the cast and crew were gone and people eventually went on to praise Yen for his portrayal of Yip Man. The success of the film also led to other successful directors and producers approaching Yen and giving him offers to work in front of the camera.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Through his progression in the Hong Kong film industry from the start - when he was just like other action performers in Hong Kong trying to make a name for themselves - to nowadays as arguably among the most offering leading Hong Kong actors and the most promising action director, as long as Donnie Yen is still active in film-making (whether working in front of or behind the camera), he will almost certainly break new grounds and create more innovative concepts of action choreography for the martial arts action genre.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0.5em 0px 0.75em; line-height: 18.2px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">\r\n	<em>- IMDb Mini Biography By:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/name?bio_author=DooK&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha" name="ba" style="color: rgb(112, 87, 157); text-decoration: none;">DooK</a></em></p>\r\n'),
